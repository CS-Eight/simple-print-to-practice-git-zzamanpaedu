# Python Starter Template

Welcome to your first Python programming assignment! This template will help you get started with Python.

## Assignment: Test Out Printing

Your first task is to learn how to use the `print()` function in Python to display text on the screen.

## Getting Started

1. **Make sure Python is installed**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Type `python --version` or `python3 --version`
   - You should see Python 3.x.x

2. **Run the program**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. **Edit the program**
   - Open `main.py` in your favorite text editor
   - Try changing the message inside the `print()` function
   - Add your own print statements
   - Save the file and run it again to see your changes

## What You'll Learn

- How to use the `print()` function
- How to run a Python program
- Basic Python syntax

## Need Help?

- Comments in Python start with `#` - these are notes that Python ignores
- The `print()` function displays whatever is inside the parentheses
- Text must be inside quotes: `"like this"` or `'like this'`
